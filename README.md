The idea behind this project was to create a static website for a charity organisation here in Limerick called Limerick’s Gateway to Education. The idea of this project is to show case what I have learnt and apply it to a real-world scenario. 



## UX Brief

Before starting the project, contacted and had a meeting with the CEO of Limerick’ Gateway to Education(LGTE), presented my idea of redesigning the website. 
Made sure to take down some notes on what she would love to see on the new site and was given permission to use content already on the old website wish made things a bit easier for me because did not have to spend much time writing content.

* The main aim of this website is to show the good work that this charity organisation is doing.
* Show how people can contribute with donations or volunteer their time for a good cause.
* There are projects that take place which help the local community of Limerick and the aim was to highlight this as well.
* There is also an eCommerce side of the organization where they sell second hand books, but chose to leave that part out as part of this project but planning to implement that by linking a WordPress subdirectory to this static site soon.
* Assets folder contains the different stages of the site devlopment and ideas gone through before final presentation.

### Initial Set Up of the Website

First had to go through the ideas needed to present on the website. Did a rough pencil sketch of what the site will look like before attempting on making a mockup. 
Then used Adobe Photoshop to design a more colorful wireframe of the website. This turned out to be a good idea as it helped in picking the right colors and fonts for CSS.

# Project Work, Bugs and Depolyment

The project was worked on using Cloud9 IDE and was pushed on to GitHub Pages at 80% from finishing. 
Did this to be sure there won't be any issues when it gets to 100% which was a good idea because the following happened: 


* Reliased Cloud9 was fixing some of my broken links and invalid HTML code when the project reviewed from the Cloud9 Run link. 
* Issues came when code was pushed to GitHub pages which picked up all the invalid HTML and was showing a different result from what was expected. 
* From a session with my tutor, realised code had not been validated.
* Using [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/) , code was scanned and pointed errors were fixed.



### Other Bugs.

* Contact form no functional yet
* Have issues with the navigation items though when it comes to tablet view.
* Parallax effect doesn't seem to work on mobile view
* Only have the facebook icon linked to a real facebook page.

## Testing

* Used the google Chrome,Opera, Firefox and Microsoft edge developer tools, but mostly Chrome and tried to pay attention to the reponsiveness of all devices available, that is from all mobile devices, tablets, laptop and desktop displays. 

* Mobile view seems to look better than desktop view.

* Git commits worked great for saving a different version of my code, which was handy because there was a lot of times because had to revert to old code as I was not happy with what I was doing so had to reset a couple of times.
