The idea behind this project was to create a static website for a charity organisation here in Limerick called Limerick’s Gateway to Education. The idea of this project is to show case what I have learnt and apply it to a real-world scenario. 



## Brief

Before starting the project, contacted and had a meeting with the CEO of Limerick’ Gateway to Education(LGTE), presented my idea of redesigning the website. 
Made sure to take down some notes on what she would love to see on the new site and was given permission to use content already on the old website wish made things a bit easier for me because did not have to spend much time writing content.

* The main aim of this website is to show the good work that this charity organisation is doing.
* Show how people can contribute with donations or volunteer their time for a good cause.
* There are projects that take place which help the local community of Limerick and the aim was to highlight this as well.
* There is also an eCommerce side of the organization where they sell second hand books, but chose to leave that part out as part of this project but planning to implement that by linking a WordPress subdirectory to this static site soon.

### Initial Set Up of the Website

First had to go through the ideas needed to present on the website. Did a rough pencil sketch of what the site will look like before attempting on making a mockup. 
Then used Adobe Photoshop to design a more colorful wireframe of the website. This turned out to be a good idea as it helped in picking the right colors and fonts for CSS.

## File List

* Index.html (This is the landing page of the Site)
```
Presented a brief of what the whole site is all about. 
Used the read more buttons to link to specific topics of the page and not cram a lot of text on one page. 
From this page, a user can access any page on the website.
```

* About.html 
```
This page tells of the history of Limerick’s Gateway to Education

```

* Donations.html
```
The main purpose of this page is to inform the user on how they can contribute.
```

* Contact.html
```
Here you will find contact details of LGTE and a contact form.
The form however is not functional.
```

* Volunteer.html
```
This page also has a contact form which is directed to people who wish to contribute their time.
```

* Homeworkclub.html
```
This page saves to explain how donations are put to use and hopefully get people to realise they can change some people’s lives through their generosity.
```
*Assets Folder

This folder containers sub-folders 'css,images and icons' and keeps all the images and icons used on the project as well as the css file "style.css".

### Bugs to Fix

* Contact form no functional yet
* Have issues with the navigation items though when it comes to tablet view.
* Parallax effect doesn't seem to work on mobile view
* Only have the facebook icon linked to a reall facebook page.

## Testing

* Used the google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft edge developer tools, but mostly Chrome and tried to pay attention to the reponsiveness of all devices available, that is from all mobile devices, tablets, laptop and desktop displays. 

* Mobile view seems to look better than desktop view.

* Git commits worked great for saving a different version of my code, which was handy because there was a lot of times because had to revert to old code as I was not happy with what I was doing so had to reset a couple of times.
